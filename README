Maptastic.pm version 1.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This module provides `mapcar', `mapcaru' `mapeach'; the first of these
functions has been known to the LISP community for some time, albeit
with widely differing behaviour.

map_each is a version of map for hashes.  There are also some other
similar mappy functions, like `filter'

There are also iterator versions of all these functions, as well as
several built-ins.  The support is not completed, however I felt that
the partial pieces in this module should be released anyway.  Patches
to implement the remaining functionality more than welcome.

This module is to be considered in an alpha stage of interface for the
next few months.  If there are no major objections, the interface will
be set in stone after that time.  Please, provide feedback to say
whether you liked the interface or not.
